# Security Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the LifeOS application and best practices for deployment.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Express Validator**: Validates all user inputs with strict rules
- **Mongo Sanitize**: Prevents NoSQL injection attacks
- **File Upload Validation**: Restricts file types and sizes
- **Query Parameter Validation**: Validates pagination and search parameters

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **API Endpoints**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Upload Endpoints**: 10 uploads per 15 minutes per IP
- **Nginx Level**: Additional rate limiting at reverse proxy level

### 3. Security Headers
- **Helmet.js**: Comprehensive security headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **HSTS**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing

### 4. Database Security
- **MongoDB Authentication**: Enabled with username/password
- **Redis Authentication**: Password-protected Redis instance
- **Connection Binding**: Database ports bound to localhost only
- **Query Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized before database queries

### 5. Docker Security
- **Non-root User**: Application runs as non-privileged user
- **Multi-stage Build**: Minimal production image
- **Security Updates**: Regular Alpine Linux security updates
- **Resource Limits**: Proper resource constraints

### 6. Network Security
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted to specific origins
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Additional security layer
- **Connection Limiting**: Prevents connection flooding
- **SSL/TLS Ready**: HTTPS configuration prepared

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Change all default passwords in `.env` file
- [ ] Set strong `JWT_SECRET` if using authentication
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for your domain
- [ ] Enable SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Review and test rate limiting settings
- [ ] Verify database authentication is working

### Production Environment
- [ ] Use environment variables for all secrets
- [ ] Enable firewall rules to restrict database access
- [ ] Set up log monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement backup strategies for databases
- [ ] Regular security updates for Docker images
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activities

### Nginx Configuration
- [ ] Enable SSL/TLS with strong ciphers
- [ ] Configure proper SSL certificate
- [ ] Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Review rate limiting rules
- [ ] Enable access logging

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update all values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your secure values
```

**Critical**: Never commit `.env` files to version control!

## Regular Security Maintenance

1. **Update Dependencies**: Run `npm audit` and `npm update` regularly
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check for suspicious activities
3. **Review Access**: Audit user access and permissions
4. **Backup Verification**: Test backup restoration procedures
5. **Security Scanning**: Use tools like `npm audit`, `docker scan`

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to your security team
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be resolved before public disclosure

## Additional Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Implement DDoS protection
- Set up intrusion detection systems
- Use secrets management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Enable audit logging for all database operations
- Implement proper backup encryption

### For Development
- Use different credentials for development and production
- Regularly update development dependencies
- Use linting tools to catch security issues early
- Implement security testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Security Testing

Run security checks:

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Security linting (if configured)
npm run lint:security

# Docker security scanning
docker scan your-image-name
```

## Compliance Considerations

This application implements security measures that help with:
- GDPR compliance (data protection)
- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- OWASP Top 10 protection
- PCI DSS requirements (if handling payments)

Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regularly review and update your security measures.
