## Chat

### View All File Changes Summary

It is now possible to view a summary of all the file changes done in a specific turn using the setting `chat.checkpoints.showFileChanges`. When enabled, it will show a widget showing all the edits done during a turn. You can also view all the file changes of the turn at once in a multi-diff editor from there.

### Sign-in / Sign-up with Google

The option to sign-in or sign-up to GitHub Copilot with a Google account is now generally rolling out to all users in VS Code.

![Sign in dialog with Google account](images/1_104/google.png)

You can find more information about this over at the [related GitHub blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-15-social-login-with-google-is-now-generally-available).

### Secondary sidebar with Chat visible in new workspaces by default

**Setting**: `setting(workbench.secondarySideBar.defaultVisibility)`

When you open a workspace for the first time, the secondary sidebar will show by default inviting you to ask questions or start an agentic session right away. This can be controlled via the `setting(workbench.secondarySideBar.defaultVisibility)` or the dropdown of the view itself:

![Secondary sidebar visibility](images/1_104/auxview.png)

### New setting to hide and disable GitHub Copilot AI features

**Setting**: `setting(chat.disableAIFeatures)`

We are introducing a new setting `setting(chat.disableAIFeatures)` that disables and hides built-in AI features provided by GitHub Copilot, including chat, code completions and next edit suggestions.

The setting has the following advantages over the previous solution we had in place:
* it syncs across your devices unless you disable this explicitly
* it will disable the Copilot extensions in case they are installed
* the setting can be set per-profile or per-workspace making it easy to disable AI features selectively

**Note**: users that were hiding AI features previously will continue to see AI features hidden. You can update the setting in addition if you want to synchronize your choice across devices.

### Support skipping tool calls

TODO: Connor

### Terminal auto approve

#### UI entry point

Terminal auto approve now has a dedicated UI entry point that allows conveniently adding rules based on the command being run. This provided 3 standard options that may differ depending on the context:

- Approve the sub-command(s) - for `foo --arg && bar` this would add rules `"foo"` and `"bar"`, allowing those 2 commands with any arguments.
- Approve the exact command line - for  `foo --arg && bar` this would add the rule  `"/^foo --arg && bar$/`.
- Configure auto approve which opens settings.

![The 3 standard options are presented for "foo --arg && bar"](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-ui.png)

_Theme: [Sapphire](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/Tyriar.theme-sapphire))_

This has some basic support for commands to suggest sub-commands where they would be more appropriate, such as suggesting a `npm test` rule rather than `npm`.

#### Reasoning

One of the problems with auto approve had been the lack of transparency around what rules are doing what. Last version we added the ability to see this reasoning in the log files, but we now surface this right in the UI.

![When git show was run it shows under the tool call that it was approved by the rule "git show"](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-reasoning.png)

This doesn't just show the rules, but are also links directly to the relevant settings (user, remote, workspace). Freshly added rules will also show immediately for improved transparency and give the user the ability to easily undo the addition if needed.

![Adding new rules will show under the tool call that they were just added with links to action them](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-new-links.png)

#### New defaults

A set of default commands are being added which approves a pretty significant amount of commands automatically. You can see the full list of rules by viewing the setting's default value by opening your settings.json file, then entering `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` and completing it via `tab`.

These defaults aim to provide a good amount of safety and reduce the amount of noise so that you can focus on the approvals that actually matter. An good example of these defaults providing additional safety is that the average user may go ahead and auto approve all `find` commands assuming it was safe, unbeknownst to them that there are several arguments that allow execution of arbitrary commands such as `-exec` or `-ok`. We handle these edge cases in the defaults where we allow find but only when one of these dangerous arguments isn't used.

#### New rule capabilities

Non-regex rules that contain a back or forward slash character will now be treated as a path and not only approve that exact path but also allow either slash type and also a `./` prefix. So a rule of `"scripts/test.sh"` will allow:

- `scripts/test.sh`
- `scripts\test.sh`
- `./scripts/test.sh`
- `.\scripts\test.sh`

Additionally when the shell is PowerShell, all rules are forced to be case insensitive to align with how that shell works.

#### Opt-in warning

Auto approval for the terminal tool is very powerful and helps streamline agent interactions. In order to educate users more about the risks of enabling auto approvals like this, especially when custom rules are added, the user must now opt-in via the dropdown before any terminal commands are auto approved.

![Before terminal auto approve starts working you must enable it via the Allow dropdown](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-opt-in.png)
![When the enable entry is used, a dialog will appear and warn you about ](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-opt-in2.png)

The link goes to [this new page on our website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/security) that goes into detail on agent mode security.

#### Global toggle with policy support

There is a new setting `chat.tools.terminal.enableAutoApprove` that allows you to force the terminal auto approve setting off. This can also be controlled by group policy when tightening of security is necessary.

### Terminal tool warning for curl and similar commands

When agent mode wants to execute `curl`, `wget`, `Invoke-RestMethod` and `Invoke-WebRequest`, a new warning will show warning about the risk of prompt injection as pulling context from the internet is the most common vector for prompt injection attacks.

![These commands will show the warning "Web content may contain malicious code or attempt prompt injection attacks."](images/1_104/terminal-tool-curl.png)

### More terminal tools to core

Like [the `runInTerminal` tool last release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_103#_improved-reliability-and-performance-of-the-run-in-terminal-and-task-tools), the `terminalSelection` and `terminalLastCommand` tools have been moved from the extension to core which should provide general improvements to reliability.

### Configurable terminal tool shell integration timeout

Whenever the run in terminal tool tries to create a terminal, it much wait a period for shell integration to activate. If your shell is especially slow to startup, say you have a very heavy PowerShell profile, this could cause it to wait the previous 5s timeout and still end up failing in the end. This timeout is now configurable via the `chat.tools.terminal.shellIntegrationTimeout` setting.

### Prevent Command Prompt usage

Since shell integration isn't really possible in Command Prompt, at least with the capabilities that Copilot needs, Copilot will now opt to use Windows PowerShell instead which should have shell integration by default. This should improve the reliability of the run in terminal tool when your default shell is Command Prompt.

If for some reason you want Copilot to use Command Prompt, this is currently not possible but we will likely be adding the ability to customize the terminal profile used by Copilot soon which is tracked in [#253945](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/253945).

### Global auto approve setting change and warning

Global auto approve aka "YOLO mode" has been [an experimental setting since v1.99](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_99#_agent-mode-tool-approvals). What we have observed is that users have been enabling this without thinking deeply enough about the consequences of what that means. Additionally, some users thought that enabling the `chat.tools.autoApprove` setting was a pre-requisite to enabling terminal auto approve which was never true.

To combat these misconceptions and to further protect our users, there is now a deservedly scary looking warning the first time global auto approve attempts to be used so the user can easily back out and disable the setting. The setting has also been changed to the more clear `chat.tools.global.autoApprove` without any automatic migration so all users (accidental or intentional) will need to go and explicitly set it again.

### Math rendering in chat enabled by default

Chat now can rendered mathematical equations in responses:

![Screenshot of the Chat view, showing inline and block equations in a chat response.](images/1_104/chat-math.png)

This feature is powered by [KaTeX](https://katex.org) and supports both inline and block math equations. Inline math equations can be written by wrapping the markup in single dollar signs (`$...$`), while block math equations use two dollar signs (`$$...$$`).

Math rendering can be disabled using `setting(chat.math.enabled)`

### Improve workspace embeddings

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## MCP


## Accessibility


## Editor Experience

### Windows: support for window border color is back

**Setting**: `setting(window.border)`

We are happy to add a new setting `setting(window.border)` on Windows allowing to show a colored border around the window, depending on the setting:
* `default`: respect color theme settings, fallback to Windows settings
* `system`: respect Windows settings only (window title accent color)
* `off`: disable border colors
* `<color>`: specific color in Hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA format

You can configure colors per workspace, making it easier to distinguish which workspace is opened in which window:

![Windows border colors](images/1_104/border.png)

When you configure `window.border` as `default`, a theme is able to set the border color for active and inactive windows using the `window.activeBorder` `window.inactiveBorder` color keys. You can further override these colors from the `setting(workbench.colorCustomizations)` setting.

### Authentication: Manage your extension account preference via the Command Palette

We've added an `Accounts: Manage Extension Account Preferences` command to the Command Palette which, when invoked, shows you a list of extensions that have access to authentication accounts and lets you change the account that those extensions use. You are even able to sign in to a new account right from the list.

This builds on [the existing account management functionality that we added a year ago](/release-notes/v1_94#change-an-extensions-account-preference).

## Code Editing


## Notebooks


## Source Control

### Preview and migrate Git worktree changes
You can now preview differences between worktree files and your current workspace by right-clicking on a worktree file to open the context menu in the Source Control Changes view and selecting **Compare with Workspace**. After reviewing your changes, you can use the **Migrate Worktree Changes...** `(kb(git.migrateWorktreeChanges))`, command from the Command Palette to merge all changes from a worktree into your current workspace. This makes it easy to work across multiple worktrees and selectively bring changes back to your main repository.



## Debugging


## Tasks


## Terminal

### Terminal window discoverability and polish

We were somewhat surprised to find that a common request we see on social media is to allow terminals to be opened in separate windows. We've actually had the ability to do this for around 1 and a half years, it just hasn't been particularly discoverable. So this iteration we added many entry points for this feature:

- The new command `kb(workbench.action.terminal.newInNewWindow)`.
- The empty editor and tab well menus now have a New Terminal entry.
- The new terminal dropdown has been shuffled around and now has a New Terminal Window entry.
- The top-level terminal menu now has a New Terminal Window entry.

We also polished the experience where these new terminal windows will open in compact mode, if a new tab is added to the window it will automatically exit compact mode.

![Terminal windows now open in compact mode, hiding tabs to make more room for terminal content](images/1_104/terminal-window.png)

### Terminal actions available in terminal editors

The actions that are available in the terminal view (new terminal dropdown, clear terminal, etc.) are now also available in terminals in the editor area and terminal windows.

![Clear terminal, run active file and so on are available in the editor actions menu](images/1_104/terminal-editor-actions.png)

Just like in the terminal view you can right click the actions area to move them out of the overflow menu.

### Terminal IntelliSense improvements (Preview)

Terminal IntelliSense is getting several improvements this release:

- A bunch of performance improvements, these disproportionally affect the experience on Windows.
- `git` completions are now more reliable on Windows due to the removal of the `sed` dependency which isn't available on Windows.
- `git` completions now have familiar icons to represent commits, branches, remotes, stashes and tags.
    ![New icons show for tags and branches on completions for "git checkout"](images/1_104/terminal-suggest.png)
- A large amount of completion specs have been added: `adb`, `basename`, `bundle`, `clear`, `cut`, `date`, `dd`, `diff`, `dig`, `dirname`, `docker-compose`, `docker`, `dotnet`, `env`, `export`, `fdisk`, `fmt`, `fold`, `gh`, `go`, `htop`, `id`, `jq`, `ln`, `lsblk`, `lsof`, `mount`, `nl`, `od`, `paste`, `ping`, `pkill`, `readlink`, `rsync`, `ruby`, `ruff`, `sed`, `seq`, `shred`, `sort`, `source`, `split`, `stat`, `su`, `sudo`, `tac`, `tar`, `tee`, `time`, `tr`, `traceroute`, `tree`, `truncate`, `uniq`, `unzip`, `wc`, `where`, `whereis`, `which`, `who`, `xargs`, `xxd`, `yo`, `zip`

### Terminal sticky scroll improvements

We have now enabled terminal sticky scroll by default. We have made several improvements to provide better experience such as when using pager, and also have made terminal sticky scroll compatible with `(kb(editor.tabFocusMode))` setting.


## Languages

### JavaScript and TypeScript

#### Removed built-in Bower package IntelliSense

After reviewing usage numbers, we decided to removed our built-in `bower.json` IntelliSense. Bower has been [deprecated since 2017](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/) and our built-in support had little usage and was not being actively maintained.

Bower recommends that users migrate to `npm` or `yarn`. Continued support for Bower in VS Code can be provided by extensions.


### Python

#### The Python Environments extension supports Pipenv

Pipenv environments can now be discovered and selected just like in the Python extension. In addition, they appear in the **Environment Manager** view in the Python sidebar, where they are grouped and displayed alongside your other environment types.

![Screenshot showing the Python sidebar with Pipenv environments expanded.](images/1_104/pipenv-supported-screenshot.png)

#### New Setting To Control Environment Variable Injection

A new setting, `python.useEnvFile`, controls whether environment variables from `.env` files and the `python.envFile` setting are injected into terminals when the Python Environments extension is enabled.

#### Python Environments extension improvements

The [Python Environments Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs) continued to receive bug fixes and improvements as part of the controlled roll-out to stable users. To use the Python Environments extension during the roll-out, make sure the extension is installed and add the following to your VS Code `settings.json` file: `"python.useEnvironmentsExtension": true`.

#### Experimental AI-powered hover summaries with Pylance
A new experimental AI Hover Summaries feature is now available for Python when using Pylance. When you enable the `setting(python.analysis.aiHoverSummaries`) setting, you can get helpful summaries on the fly for symbols that do not already have documentation. This makes it easier to understand unfamiliar code and boosts productivity as you explore Python projects. AI Hover Summaries are currently available to GitHub Copilot Pro, Pro+, and Enterprise users.

<video src="images/1_104/pylance-hover-summaries.mp4" title="Video showing AI-powered hover summaries with Pylance." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Run Code Snippet tool
The Pylance Run Code Snippets tool is a powerful feature designed to streamline your Python experience with GitHub Copilot. Instead of relying on terminal commands like `python -c "code"` or creating temporary files to be executed, this tool allows GitHub Copilot to execute Python snippets entirely in memory. It automatically uses the correct Python interpreter configured for your workspace, and it eliminates common issues with shell escaping and quoting that sometimes arise during terminal execution.

One of the standout benefits is the clean, well-formatted output it provides, with both stdout and stderr interleaved for clarity. This makes it ideal when using Agent mode with GitHub Copilot to test small blocks of code, run quick scripts, validate Python expressions, or checking imports, all within the context of your workspace.

To try it out, you can select the `pylancerunCodeSnippet` tool via the **Add context...** menu in the VS Code Chat panel.

> **Note**: As with all AI-generated code, please make sure to inspect the generated code before allowing this tool to be executed. Reviewing the logic and intent of the code ensures it aligns with your project's goals and maintains safety and correctness.

<video src="images/1_104/pylance-run-code-snippet.mp4" title="Code snippet generated and executed by GitHub Copilot in the Chat panel via the pylancerunCodeSnippet tool." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Pylance IntelliSense enabled in all Python documents by default

Pylance IntelliSense is now enabled by default in all Python documents, including terminal and diff views. With the `setting(python.analysis.supportAllPythonDocuments)` setting now set to True by default, you get rich code completions, hover and code navigation wherever you work with Python in VS Code.

#### Activation hooks

Python activation hooks can now run from shell integration scripts, instead of requiring the Python environment extension to modify your shell profile. This provides more reliable terminal activation when `(kb(python-envs.terminal.autoActivationType))` is set to shellStartup and, importantly, ensures Copilot terminals are activated as expected.


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_103.md).


## Contributions to extensions


## Extension Authoring

### shellIntegrationNonce for extension launched terminals

`shellIntegrationNonce` can now be passed to `createTerminal` in `TerminalOptions` and `ExtensionTerminalOptions`. This allows the extension to control the nonce which is used to verify commands [in shell integration escape sequences](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_supported-escape-sequences).

### New chat provider API

<!-- TODO: lramos15 -->


## Proposed APIs

### Authentication: Supporting `WWW-Authenticate` challenges in `getSession`

A well-established pattern of HTTP is that a request to an API can return a 401 Unauthorized status code with a [WWW-Authenticate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/WWW-Authenticate) header which defines "auth challenges". These are essentially things that the API needs in order to resolve past the 401.

We have introduced a proposed API which allows for the passing down and handling of these challenges to authentication providers. First off, from the calling side you can now pass in a challenge like so:
```ts
export interface AuthenticationWWWAuthenticateRequest {
	/**
	 * The raw WWW-Authenticate header value that triggered this challenge.
	 * This will be parsed by the authentication provider to extract the necessary
	 * challenge information.
	 */
	readonly wwwAuthenticate: string;

	/**
	 * Optional scopes for the session. If not provided, the authentication provider
	 * may use default scopes or extract them from the challenge.
	 */
	readonly scopes?: readonly string[];
}

export namespace authentication {
		// NOTE: The only change is the 2nd parameter, the other variations of `getSession` have the same change
		export function getSession(providerId: string, scopeListOrRequest: ReadonlyArray<string> | AuthenticationWWWAuthenticateRequest, options?: AuthenticationGetSessionOptions): Thenable<AuthenticationSession | undefined>;
}
```

And on the Authentication Provider side, you can handle these challenges like so by implementing the `getSessionsFromChallenges` and `createSessionFromChallenges` functions:
```ts
/**
 * Represents an authentication challenge from a WWW-Authenticate header.
 * This is used to handle cases where additional authentication steps are required,
 * such as when mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced.
 */
export interface AuthenticationChallenge {
	/**
	 * The authentication scheme (e.g., 'Bearer').
	 */
	readonly scheme: string;

	/**
	 * Parameters for the authentication challenge.
	 * For Bearer challenges, this may include 'claims', 'scope', 'realm', etc.
	 */
	readonly params: Record<string, string>;
}

/**
 * Represents constraints for authentication, including challenges and optional scopes.
 * This is used when creating or retrieving sessions that must satisfy specific authentication
 * requirements from WWW-Authenticate headers.
 */
export interface AuthenticationConstraint {
	/**
	 * Array of authentication challenges parsed from WWW-Authenticate headers.
	 */
	readonly challenges: readonly AuthenticationChallenge[];

	/**
	 * Optional scopes for the session. If not provided, the authentication provider
	 * may extract scopes from the challenges or use default scopes.
	 */
	readonly scopes?: readonly string[];
}

/**
 * An authentication provider that supports challenge-based authentication.
 * This extends the base AuthenticationProvider with methods to handle authentication
 * challenges from WWW-Authenticate headers.
 */
export interface AuthenticationProvider {
	/**
	 * Get existing sessions that match the given authentication constraints.
	 *
	 * @param constraint The authentication constraint containing challenges and optional scopes
	 * @param options Options for the session request
	 * @returns A thenable that resolves to an array of existing authentication sessions
	 */
	getSessionsFromChallenges?(constraint: AuthenticationConstraint, options: AuthenticationProviderSessionOptions): Thenable<readonly AuthenticationSession[]>;

	/**
	 * Create a new session based on authentication constraints.
	 * This is called when no existing session matches the constraint requirements.
	 *
	 * @param constraint The authentication constraint containing challenges and optional scopes
	 * @param options Options for the session creation
	 * @returns A thenable that resolves to a new authentication session
	 */
	createSessionFromChallenges?(constraint: AuthenticationConstraint, options: AuthenticationProviderSessionOptions): Thenable<AuthenticationSession>;
}

export interface AuthenticationProviderOptions {
  // You need to include this when registering.
	supportsChallenges?: boolean;
}
```

#### Example: Azure MFA

This work was initially done [due to an upcomming change to require MFA in Azure APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication) so let's also use that as an example of this API.

Let's say you have an extension that creates a resoure in Azure. All that's doing is calling an Azure RM API, nothing fancy...  Your extension is probably already familiar with calling `vscode.authentication.getSession` to get an authentication session, mainly an access token, that can be used to call this API. Now, when you first minted that authentication session, depending on your organization, you may or may NOT have gone through multi-factor authentication (MFA). If you did, then the Azure API will be happy. If you _didn't_ go through MFA, then Azure's API will return a 401 and a `WWW-Authenticate` header.

Now comes our new API in VS Code... all you have to do is take that header value, and pass it right in to `vscode.authentication.getSession`:
```ts
const newRequest = {
  wwwAuthenticate: theRawHeaderValue,
  scopes: scopesFromPreviousRequest
}
const sessionWithMFA = await vscode.authentication.getSession('microsoft', newRequest, options)
```

This will pass that header value down to the auth provider, `microsoft` in this case, and the auth provider will be responsible for minting a session in which the challenges are satisfied.

On the auth provider side, we can implement, and have implemented in Microsoft Authentication, the following new functions on `AuthenticationProvider`:

```ts
getSessionsFromChallenges(constraint: AuthenticationConstraint, options: AuthenticationProviderSessionOptions): Thenable<readonly AuthenticationSession[]>;
createSessionFromChallenges(constraint: AuthenticationConstraint, options: AuthenticationProviderSessionOptions): Thenable<AuthenticationSession>;
```

In the Azure scenario, the `constraint` is going to look like this:
```
{
  challenges: [
    {
      scheme: 'Bearer',
      params: {
        claims: someBase64EncodedString
      }
    }
  ]
  scopes: azureRMScopes
}
```
From here, we can take those claims and pass them down to MSAL, which is what we use for Microsoft Authentication. In those claims it says that a token minted with MFA is required. If `getSessionsFromChallenges` returns no results, then `createSessionFromChallenges` will be run. In the case of Azure, you'll be taken through the Microsoft auth flow and asked to do MFA. That session will then be returned to the caller.

That's a real world example of how this API is used.

Another usecase that will be lit up soon, is for MCP servers to issue a `WWW-Authenticate` header asking for a token with more scopes. There's [a proposal in the MCP specification for this](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/835).

Next iteration we will finalize the `getSession` (aka extension asking for auth) parts of this proposal so if you have any feedback on that or the shape of the `AuthenticationProvider` changes, please let us know! You can [find the full proposal on GitHub here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a924f20c72bd8f9665894be8213ce7f5680ab528/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.authenticationChallenges.d.ts).

## Engineering

### Exploring Playwright + Playwright MCP in the inner development loop of VS Code

Agent mode and other AI features of VS Code have become a core tool (no pun intended) for the VS Code team to build VS Code itself. We wanted to explore how we can leverage these features further to make the inner development loop of VS Code even better. To that end, we have been experimenting with extending our existing smoke test [automation project](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/test/automation), which uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), to create an MCP server that can drive a local instance of VS Code. This allows our existing agentic flows, which focused on receiving context from build/test-time artifacts (compilation, linters, tests, etc), to now also interact with a live instance of VS Code... verifying that changes have the desired effect at runtime.

The first piece of this work, can be found [in the test/mcp folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/test/mcp) of the vscode repo. If you're interested in trying it out, it's very easy to get started:
1. Follow the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) for getting a local version of Code OSS running
2. Then you can use [our trivial (for now) prompt file](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/cd7de11f65cd5ff6a491f04fc013e363780bde31/.github/prompts/playwright.prompt.md) to ask a question `/playwright your question here` in Agent mode.

This is still an early exploration, but we are excited about the possibilities this opens up for us to leverage AI further in our inner development loop. The ground work is now laid, and we will be iterating on this to make it more robust and useful for the team.
